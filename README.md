## Day 2 (1 August 2025)


The second day of Induction Program at GNDEC was dedicated to the academic readiness assessment of students and enriching them with real-world knowledge to facilitate their all-round development. The day's schedule intertwined academic evaluation, awareness on health and well-being, and technical learning.

The day commenced with two vital tests—*an English Proficiency Test* and a *Mathematics Proficiency Test*. These tests were conducted to test students' existing knowledge of grammar, reading comprehension, vocabulary, logical reasoning, and mathematical ability. These tests formed the benchmark for future guidance and growth and allowed faculty to have an idea about the students' academic level.

After the testing, students took a break for lunch, while during which time they were able to relax, socialize with friends, and recharge for the afternoon half of the day.

The afternoon session had a very insightful lecture by *Dr. Arashdeep Singh* of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU). His subject, "Food: A Pivotal Role in Student's Overall Wellness," highlighted the importance of a healthy diet not only for physical well-being but also for mental acuity. He provided practical suggestions on how students can lead a healthy life through judicious food intake even with their studies.

This was followed by an educative *Scholarship Awareness Session* conducted by members from *Buddy4Study (Noida). The group gave in-depth details about the **Satya Scholarship Program 2025*. They described the eligibility criteria and gave a step-by-step guide on how to apply, equipping students with the information to get financial assistance throughout their studies.

At the close of the day, students were also introduced to the *Causmic Club, which officially kicked off the technical activities of the Induction Program. Students were directed to set up their own **GitHub accounts* and obtained a brief introduction to version control, repositories, and markdown files. This hands-on activity prompted students to take their first steps into open-source collaboration and portfolio development—abilities critical in the tech world today.

## Day 3 (4 August 2025) 

The session for the day was led by a warm welcome by the anchor, a senior *Cosmic Club* member.

The day was the second session taken by *Priya Darshani Ma'am on *Universal Human Values (UHV). The session prompted us to think and look within ourselves and question where we end up spending most of our time—on **right understanding**, **relationships**, and **physical facilities*.

#### Key Takeaways
- The distinction between *excitement* and *happiness*.
- Significance of *shifting from excitement to happiness* through correct understanding.
- Idea of *self-exploration* as an ongoing process.
- "Whatever is stated is a proposal"—we "must check it through our *natural acceptance* and *experimental validation*.

#### Understanding Desire:
Three sources of desire were discussed:
1. *Preconditioning*
2. *Sensation*
3. *Natural Acceptance*

> Do not consider any proposal as true or false. Instead, explore and confirm.

#### Happiness vs. Unhappiness:
- *Happiness*: Synergy, harmony, and living in understanding.
- *Unhappiness*: Disharmony, contradiction, and indulgence in unhealthy habits (e.g., binge-watching, addictions).

#### Life Lessons:
- Know the self before acting.
- Train imagination before action.
- Remember that:
  - *Happiness is qualitative.*
  - *Physical facilities are quantitative.*
  - Both kinds of needs have to be satisfied *separately*.

The session ended with a meditation on *natural acceptance* and its *practical application in life*.

We ended the day with a members' session at Causmic Club, and then proceeded with emotional poetry and singing performances by our seniors.
